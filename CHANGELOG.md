# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.6.0] - 2026-05-30
### Added
- Per-patient "needs attention" sensor (`binary_sensor`, device class `problem`): red when a dose is overdue (past its time by the nag window and still not given), green when all is well. It re-evaluates on a 60-second timer so it trips on elapsed time alone, with no interaction, and fails safe toward "problem" rather than a false "all clear". Drives a simple red/green status panel and any light, siren, or notification you wire to it.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-05-30
### Added
- Patient type (Person, Dog, Cat, Bird, Rabbit, Other), chosen in the config flow and editable in Reminder settings. It sets the icon on the patient's "all doses given" sensor and is exposed as a `patient_type` attribute. Dose switches keep the pill icon.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-30
### Added
- Per-patient `binary_sensor` that is on when all of that patient's doses are given today, with `total`, `given`, `remaining`, and `pending` attributes. Useful for automations and dashboards.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-30
### Added
- Per-patient reminder settings in the UI (Configure, Reminder settings): daily reset time, nag window, and re-nag interval. These are exposed as switch attributes (`nag_minutes`, `nag_interval`) that the companion automations read, so changes take effect with no YAML edits.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-05-30
### Changed
- Dose entity names now show the medications inline, e.g. `Buddy 2:00 PM (Trazodone)`, so the toggle list matches the summary card.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-05-30
### Changed
- Dose entity names now display the time in 12-hour format (e.g. `2:00 PM` instead of `14:00`).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-29
### Added
- Per-patient notify target, selectable in the config flow and editable via the options flow.
- `notify_service` attribute on each dose switch, so the companion automations route reminders to the right person or group per patient.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-29
### Added
- Initial alpha release.
- UI config flow: add a patient, then add or remove doses (time + medications).
- One switch per dose (on = given today), grouped under a device per patient.
- Daily reset of all doses at 00:01; given/not-given state survives restarts.
- Companion automations for actionable, nagging, missed-dose reminders.
- Bundled dashboard card (12-hour summary + auto-entities).
