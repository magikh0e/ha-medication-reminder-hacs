[![Open your Home Assistant instance and add this repository to HACS.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=magikh0e&repository=ha-medication-reminder-hacs&category=integration)

A Home Assistant custom integration for tracking medication doses, for pets *and*
people. Add patients and their dose schedule **in the UI**; the integration
auto-creates a switch per dose (on = given today) and resets them daily. Pair it
with the included companion automations for actionable, nagging, missed-dose
reminders synced across every Companion app.

This is the UI-driven sibling of the YAML package at
[ha-medication-reminder](https://github.com/magikh0e/ha-medication-reminder).
Prefer pure YAML? Use that one. Want point-and-click dose management with
auto-created entities? Use this.

> ⚠️ **Alpha software.** This is new and not yet widely tested. Validate it on
> your own Home Assistant before relying on it, and keep a backup reminder method
> until you trust it. It is a reminder aid, **not** a medical device. Confirm
> dosing schedules with your doctor or vet.

## Highlights

- **Pets and people, all in the UI.** Add patients and their dose schedule from Settings, no YAML; entities auto-create per patient and survive restarts.
- **Glanceable, fail-safe status.** A per-patient red/green "needs attention" sensor that trips on elapsed time alone and fails safe toward "problem", wire it to a panel, light, or siren.
- **Supply & refill tracking.** Per-medication counts that decrement as doses are given, with doses-left, a run-out estimate, a low-stock red flag at your reorder threshold, and a refill reminder.
- **Flexible scheduling.** Each dose daily, on specific days of the week, or every N days from a start date, 12h or 24h display.
- **Actionable reminders.** Nagging, missed-dose escalation, and a "Mark given" button from the notification, routed per patient.
- **Zero-edit dashboard.** Auto-discovers every patient and dose, no names to maintain.

## What it does

- 🖱️ **UI configuration:** add a patient, choose who to notify, then add doses (a time + the medications) from Settings. No YAML for the schedule.
- 🗓️ **Flexible scheduling:** each dose can be daily, limited to specific days of the week (e.g. Mondays only, or Mon/Wed/Fri), or every N days from a start date (e.g. every other day). It only reminds and counts on the days it is due.
- 👥 **Per-patient notify target:** pick the person or group to remind for each patient in the UI (e.g. one dog's reminders to you, another's to a partner).
- 🔀 **Auto-created entities:** each dose becomes a `switch` (on = given today), grouped under a device per patient.
- ♻️ **Daily reset:** every dose flips back to "not given" at 00:01.
- 💾 **Restart-safe:** dose state survives Home Assistant restarts.
- 🔔 **Reminders via companion automations:** the included `companion-automations.yaml` reads the dose switches and sends actionable, nagging, missed-dose notifications (this v0.1 keeps notifications in YAML so you reuse proven logic).
- 📦 **Supply & refill tracking (optional):** track how many doses of a medication you have on hand. It counts down as doses are marked given, shows doses left and an estimated run-out date, flags low stock red at your threshold, and can send a refill reminder.
- ⏰ **Early-dose warning (optional):** if a dose is marked given well before its scheduled time, a companion automation warns the caretaker, with an "undo" button to un-mark it if it was a mistake. A soft over-dose guard that flags likely slips without blocking you.

## Why entities + YAML (not all-in-one, yet)

v0.1 deliberately keeps the *notification* logic in battle-tested YAML
automations and lets the integration own the *config UI* and *entities*. That
gives you the big win (no more hand-declared helpers, UI-managed schedule)
without putting medication-critical notification code into brand-new, untested
territory. A future version may move reminders into the integration itself.

## Installation

### 1. Install the integration (HACS custom repository)

Use the **Open your Home Assistant instance** button at the top of this page to add the repo to HACS in one step, then install and restart, or do it manually:

1. HACS, top-right menu, **Custom repositories**.
2. Add `https://github.com/magikh0e/ha-medication-reminder-hacs` as an **Integration**.
3. Install **Medication Reminder**, then restart Home Assistant.

(Or copy `custom_components/medication_reminder/` into your HA `config/custom_components/` and restart.)

### Updating from an earlier version

Already running an older version? You keep all your patients, doses, schedules,
and supplies. You only need to update, and for the new early-dose warning, add
one automation.

1. **Update the integration:** in HACS, open **Medication Reminder**, use the
   three-dot menu, **Redownload**, choose the latest version, then **restart Home
   Assistant**. Your existing config is preserved.
2. **Core changes apply automatically** after the restart, including the
   `medication_reminder_dose_given` and `medication_reminder_dose_undone` events
   and supply-restore-on-undo (un-marking a dose puts its supply count back).
3. **For the early-dose warning (new in 0.10.0), add its automation** (see
   **3. Add the reminder automations** below). Import the
   [`early_dose.yaml`](blueprints/automation/medication_reminder/early_dose.yaml)
   blueprint, or if you use the pasted
   [`companion-automations.yaml`](companion-automations.yaml), re-paste the
   updated file. If you copy the YAML, **replace** your existing
   `medication_reminder_*` automations rather than adding a second copy, so
   reminders are not duplicated.
4. *(Optional)* **Switch from pasted YAML to blueprints.** Blueprints are new in
   0.10.0; to manage automations by one-click import and update, delete your old
   pasted automations and import the blueprints described below.

### 2. Add patients and doses

1. **Settings, Devices & Services, Add Integration, Medication Reminder.**
2. Enter the patient name (e.g. a pet or person), pick the **patient type** (Person / Dog / Cat / ..., which sets the icon), and the **notify target** (the person or group to remind). One patient per entry; add the integration again for more patients.
3. On the entry, click **Configure** to **Add a dose** (pick a time, type the medications, and choose the **days of the week** it applies to - all days = daily). Repeat for each dose. **Remove a dose** or open **Reminder settings** (type, notify target, time format, reset time, nag window/interval) there too.

Each dose appears as `switch.<patient>_<time>` with attributes `patient`,
`dose_time`, `medications`, and `notify_service`.

### 3. Add the reminder automations

The integration creates the entities; the reminders, nagging, missed-dose
escalation, refill reminders, and early-dose warning are driven by automations.
Pick one of two ways to add them:

**Blueprints (recommended), one-click import and easy updates.** In **Settings,
Automations & Scenes, Blueprints, Import Blueprint**, paste each URL you want,
then create an automation from it. To update later, re-import the blueprint (its
**three-dot menu, Re-import**) and the automations created from it pick up the
change automatically, with their inputs preserved. A HACS integration update
does **not** need a re-import; only re-import when a release note says a
blueprint itself changed.

- Reminders and missed-dose escalation (core):
  `https://github.com/magikh0e/ha-medication-reminder-hacs/blob/main/blueprints/automation/medication_reminder/medication_reminders.yaml`
- Mark given from notification (core, pairs with the above):
  `https://github.com/magikh0e/ha-medication-reminder-hacs/blob/main/blueprints/automation/medication_reminder/mark_given.yaml`
- Early-dose warning (optional):
  `https://github.com/magikh0e/ha-medication-reminder-hacs/blob/main/blueprints/automation/medication_reminder/early_dose.yaml`
- Low-supply refill reminder (optional):
  `https://github.com/magikh0e/ha-medication-reminder-hacs/blob/main/blueprints/automation/medication_reminder/low_supply.yaml`

**Or copy the YAML.** Paste the automations from
[`companion-automations.yaml`](companion-automations.yaml) into your
`automations.yaml` and reload; re-paste to update.

Each patient's reminders go to the **notify target you chose in the UI** (read
from the switch's `notify_service` attribute). The `default_notify` value in the
automation (`caretakers`) is only a fallback if a switch has no target set; if
you want a fallback group, define it, for example:
```yaml
notify:
  - platform: group
    name: caretakers
    services:
      - service: mobile_app_your_phone
```

They send a reminder when a dose is due and not given, nag every 15 minutes for
45 minutes, then escalate once as a time-sensitive "missed" alert. Tapping
**Mark given** turns the dose's switch on and clears the notification.

### 4. Dashboard (optional)

The bundled [`lovelace-card.yaml`](lovelace-card.yaml) is an auto-discovering,
day-of-week-aware dashboard that needs **no editing**: it finds every patient and
dose automatically, so adding, renaming, or removing a patient just updates it.
Five parts:

1. a red/green status panel (from the `needs_attention` sensors),
2. a summary of **today's** scheduled doses (given / still to give, with times),
3. one combined "Mark given" card with every dose due today (tap to mark),
4. one combined supplies card (units on hand, shown only if you track supplies),
5. a per-patient schedule overview (every dose, time, medications, and days).

It needs two HACS cards: [auto-entities](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-auto-entities)
(the auto-discovering lists) and [card-mod](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-card-mod)
(the pill icons are pinned blue so they stay out of the red/yellow/green status
colours; without card-mod the pills fall back to amber). Paste it as a manual
card, no names or entity_ids to change. The standalone status panel is below if
you only want that piece, and it needs no HACS cards at all.

For a wide area, [`lovelace-card-2col.yaml`](lovelace-card-2col.yaml) lays the
same cards out as a full-width status banner above two columns, sized to fill a
2-column-wide [Sections](https://www.home-assistant.io/dashboards/sections/)
view section: add a section, set its width to 2, and paste it as a manual card.

![Medication Reminder dashboard layouts](dashboardupdates.png)

*The auto-discovering layout, single-column and the optional two-column variant.*

### Status panel (red/green, glanceable)

A simple "all OK / attention needed" panel for the top of a dashboard, driven by
the `needs_attention` sensors. Green when nothing is overdue, red (with who and
what) when something needs investigating. Native card, no HACS needed:

![Attention needed state](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/magikh0e/ha-medication-reminder-hacs/main/dashboard-attention-needed.png?v=2)

```yaml
type: markdown
content: |-
  {% set s = states.binary_sensor | selectattr('entity_id','search','_needs_attention') | list %}
  {% set red = s | selectattr('state','eq','on') | list %}
  {% if red | length == 0 %}
  # 🟢 All OK
  {% else %}
  # 🔴 Attention needed
  {% for p in red %}
  - **{{ p.attributes.patient }}**: {{ p.attributes.overdue | join(', ') }}
  {% endfor %}
  {% endif %}
```

Because `binary_sensor.<patient>_needs_attention` is a standard `problem` entity,
you can also drive a light, siren, pager, or notification straight off it.

**Make the panel flash when attention is needed** (needs the HACS
[card-mod](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-card-mod) card). Add this to
the markdown card above:

```yaml
card_mod:
  style: |
    ha-card {
      {% if (states.binary_sensor | selectattr('entity_id','search','_needs_attention') | selectattr('state','eq','on') | list | length) > 0 %}
      animation: mr-flash 1.2s ease-in-out infinite;
      {% endif %}
    }
    @keyframes mr-flash {
      0%, 100% { background-color: var(--card-background-color); }
      50% { background-color: rgba(244, 67, 54, 0.55); }
    }
```

For care settings, a **physical** flash is even better: trigger a lamp or siren
off the `needs_attention` sensor so the alert is visible from across the room.

### Schedule overview

A card that lists each patient's full schedule (every dose, time, medications,
and which days it applies), not just today. Auto-discovers all patients, respects
each one's 12h/24h setting, and shows "Daily" or the specific days. Native
markdown card, no HACS needed:

![Schedule overview](ScheduleOverview.png)

```yaml
type: markdown
content: |-
  ## 📋 Medication schedule
  {% set meds = states.switch | selectattr('attributes.medications','defined') | list %}
  {% set week = ['mon','tue','wed','thu','fri','sat','sun'] %}
  {% for p in (meds | map(attribute='attributes.patient') | unique | list | sort) %}
  {% set pdoses = meds | selectattr('attributes.patient','eq',p) | sort(attribute='attributes.dose_time') | list %}
  {% set ptype = pdoses[0].attributes.patient_type | default('person') %}
  ### {{ {'dog':'🐕','cat':'🐈','person':'🧑','bird':'🐦','rabbit':'🐇','other':'🐾'}.get(ptype,'💊') }} {{ p }}
  {% for d in pdoses %}
  {%- set days = d.attributes.days or week %}
  {%- set fmt = '%H:%M' if d.attributes.time_format == '24h' else '%-I:%M %p' %}
  - **{{ as_timestamp(today_at(d.attributes.dose_time)) | timestamp_custom(fmt) }}** {{ d.attributes.medications }} ({{ 'Daily' if days|length == 7 else (week | select('in', days) | map('capitalize') | join(', ')) }})
  {%- endfor %}
  {% endfor %}
```

## How marking works (the contract)

- The integration publishes `switch.*` entities carrying `patient` / `patient_type` / `dose_time` / `medications` / `days` / `schedule_type` / `interval_days` / `anchor_date` / `scheduled_today` / `given_at` / `notify_service` attributes (a dose is only reminded, counted, or flagged overdue when `scheduled_today` is true, which respects both day-of-week and every-N-days schedules). Per patient it also publishes two binary sensors:
  - `binary_sensor.<patient>_all_doses_given` (patient-type icon) - on when all of that patient's doses are given today, with `total` / `given` / `remaining` / `pending` attributes.
  - `binary_sensor.<patient>_needs_attention` (device class `problem`) - **red when a dose is overdue** (past its time by the nag window and still not given), green when all is well. It re-evaluates on a 60-second timer so it trips on elapsed time alone, and fails safe toward "problem". Attributes: `overdue` / `overdue_count`.
- The companion reminder automation iterates those switches and routes each reminder to its `notify_service` / `nag_minutes` / `nag_interval`, so adding a dose or changing a patient's settings in the UI needs **no** automation edits.
- "Mark given" flips the switch on; the daily reset flips all off at the configured reset time.
- When a dose is marked given, the switch fires a `medication_reminder_dose_given` event (with `patient`, `dose_time`, `medications`, `scheduled_today`, `minutes_early`, `notify_service`), so companion automations can react cleanly. The bundled `med_early_given` automation uses it to warn when a dose is marked given well before its scheduled time, with an "undo" button that turns the dose back off. Un-marking a dose fires `medication_reminder_dose_undone`, which restores that dose's supply count.

## Settings (per patient)

Each patient has its own **Configure, Reminder settings** with:

- **Notify target** - who gets that patient's reminders.
- **Time format** - 12-hour (`2:00 PM`) or 24-hour (`14:00`) in the dose entity names (default 12-hour).
- **Daily reset time** - when the day's doses reset to "not given" (default 00:01).
- **Nag window** - how long to keep reminding after a dose time (default 45 min).
- **Re-nag interval** - how often to re-remind within that window (default 15 min).

The reset time is applied by the integration; the nag window/interval are exposed
as switch attributes that the companion automations read.

## Supply & refill tracking

Optionally track how much of each medication you have on hand. In **Configure,
Track a medication supply**, set the medication name (exactly as it appears in the
dose), units on hand, units consumed per dose, a low-stock threshold, and a refill
amount. Each tracked medication then gets:

- `number.<patient>_<med>_supply` - units on hand, settable. It **decrements when
  a dose containing that medication is marked given** (once per dose per day,
  restart-safe, and never on the daily reset). Attributes include `doses_left` and
  `est_runout_date`, computed from the schedule. Un-marking a dose (the early-dose
  "undo" or a manual toggle-off) adds the units back. Adjust it any time to
  correct a miscount or to refill.
- `binary_sensor.<patient>_supplies_low` (device class `problem`) - **red when any
  of that patient's supplies reaches its threshold**, with a `low` list of which
  medications are short.

A medication shared across several doses (e.g. one given morning and night) draws
from a single pool; dose `meds` strings are split on `& , + /` so each medication
is tracked individually. The companion `med_supply_low` automation sends a
once-a-day refill reminder to the patient's notify target for anything low.

## Roadmap

- Optional in-integration notifications/nagging (so YAML companions become optional).
- HACS default-store submission once validated.
- Over-dose guard: a minimum interval between doses and a max-per-day cap, warning before a dose is marked given too soon or too often. An early-dose warning (a dose given before its scheduled time) shipped in 0.10.0 as a first step; the interval and daily cap remain. (Idea from community member IOT7712.)
- More schedule types beyond day-of-week. Every-N-days (every other day, every third day) shipped in 0.11.0, using a start date and a shared `scheduled_today` attribute the sensors, automations, and dashboard all honour. Day-of-month / monthly and on/off cycles remain. (Suggested by a community member.)

## Acknowledgements

The red/green "all OK / attention needed" status panel, the flashing alert, and
the aggregate-status idea were suggested by Home Assistant Community user
**IOT7712**. Thanks for the thoughtful feature requests, especially the focus on
a reliable, glanceable, fail-safe indicator for care settings.

**Supply & refill tracking** was inspired by Home Assistant Community user
**Tadies**, who built a pill counter on their dashboard with counter helpers.
Thanks for sharing it.
